        "### Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The `ConvHistory` class was successfully implemented to store conversation turns, including the role, content, and timestamp of each message.\n",
        "*   Methods for truncating the history by the last N turns (`last_n_turns`) and by character length (`truncate_by_char`) were correctly added to the `ConvHistory` class.\n",
        "*   A simple extractive summarization function (`simple_extractive_summary`) was created using basic word frequency analysis.\n",
        "*   The `SummaryManager` class was successfully implemented to manage periodic summarization, triggering a summary after a specified number of new messages (`k`) and replacing the older history with a summary while retaining the last `keep_last_n` messages.\n",
        "*   The demonstration code successfully illustrated adding messages, truncating history using both methods, and the process of periodic summarization triggered by the `SummaryManager`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "With Task 1 completed, we can now move on to **Task 2: Extracting Structured Data using Groq API and JSON Schema**. This will involve defining a JSON schema, using the Groq API for function calling to extract information from chat messages, and validating the extracted data against the schema."

        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a complete implementation of two interconnected tasks:  \n",
        "1. Managing conversational history with automated summarization.  \n",
        "2. Performing structured information extraction using JSON schema validation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Conversation Management & Summarization\n",
        "The first part of the project focuses on handling long conversation histories efficiently. A dynamic conversation buffer was maintained where messages between the user and the assistant were appended in sequence. To prevent uncontrolled growth of the log, summarization techniques were applied.  \n",
        "- Summaries were triggered periodically after a defined number of conversation turns.  \n",
        "- Different truncation strategies were tested, including limiting by number of turns and by character length.  \n",
        "- Multiple conversation samples were executed to demonstrate how history was shortened while still preserving essential context.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This ensured that even with extended interactions, the model was able to retain context without overwhelming the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### JSON Schema Classification & Information Extraction\n",
        "The second part of the project establishes a schema-driven pipeline for extracting key details such as **name, email, phone number, location, and age** directly from chat inputs. A JSON schema was designed to strictly validate the extracted output against expected data types and fields.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Using Groq’s OpenAI-compatible API with function calling, conversations were parsed and returned as structured JSON objects. Three independent chat samples were processed, and the results showed that the extracted details aligned correctly with the schema. The validation checks confirmed accuracy and consistency, with all fields adhering to the required schema format.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Results & Observations\n",
        "- Summarization logic successfully reduced conversation length without losing essential meaning.  \n",
        "- JSON extraction worked reliably, returning structured outputs for all test samples.  \n",
        "- Validation confirmed correctness: all extractions passed schema checks with no errors.  \n",
        "- The overall pipeline combined summarization and structured extraction in a lightweight, framework-free approach using only Python standard tools and Groq’s API client.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Conclusion\n",
        "The project showcases how conversational data can be effectively managed and analyzed in real-time. Summarization ensured scalability, while schema-based extraction guaranteed accuracy in capturing user information. Together, these tasks highlight a practical integration of Groq APIs for conversation management and classification in real-world scenarios."
