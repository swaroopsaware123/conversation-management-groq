# 📊 E-commerce Customer Intelligence Engine

## 📌 Project Overview
Analyzed **UK Online Retail dataset (541K+ transactions, 8 features)** to understand customer behavior, build segmentation, and develop churn prediction models.  
This project combines **EDA, RFM Analysis, Clustering, and ML models** to deliver actionable business insights.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Segment customers into actionable personas (VIP, Loyal, At-Risk, New).  
- Predict churn probability and identify revenue risks.  
- Recommend retention strategies to maximize ROI.

## 🛠️ Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** – removed duplicates, cancellations, and invalid entries.  
2. **EDA & Visualization** – revenue trends, top products, top countries.  
3. **RFM Analysis** – Recency, Frequency, Monetary value for each customer.  
4. **Clustering** – KMeans + PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
5. **Churn Prediction** – Logistic Regression & Random Forest.  
6. **Business Insights** – ROI calculation and retention strategy suggestions.

## 📊 Key Insights
- VIP customers (~8%) contribute **35% of revenue**.  
- At-Risk customers (~25%) show **42% churn probability**.  
- Recency (last purchase) was the **most important churn factor**.  
- Retention strategy projected to protect **~$2.3M annual revenue**.
